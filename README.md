# Weed-Detection-and-Reduced-Herbicide-Dose
The aim of this project is to detect a crop and and make a leaf count of the crop as a basis for categorizing them into stages and then make an appropriate recommendation of herbicide based on the weed stage. 

# Problem Statement
 The general practice of controlling emerged weeds in arable fields consists of the uniform application of a selective herbicide
 
 However, the extensive use of herbicides in the last few decades has been challenged by consumers as well as policy makers because of growing concerns regarding their potential environmental impact on nature and drinking water reservoirs.â€‹
